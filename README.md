# Factor Trading Market for Data Based on CESS Cloud Data Network (FMD-CESS)

## üå† Inspiration

With rapid advances of computing technologies such as AI and machine learning, the value of humanity's digital assets, the so-called "Digital Gold", is being discovered. Data, being one of the significant digital assets, will eventually be as important as the main production factors like land, labor, and capital in the progression of Web3.0. The inexorable rise of the digital economy has resulted in explosive growth in data generation.

Nevertheless, data transparency issues inflicted by centralization have hindered the true potential of big data to boost production and efficiency, both economically and technologically. 

There are some problems in the existing data market:

**Data Security**Ôºöprone to data breach, data loss.

**Privacy**Ôºödata disclosure to third parties,  data altercation.

**Data ownership**: no protection.

Approaches to enhance data storage security, data sharing efficiency, and the protection of data owners' rights are often complex and problematic.

Factor Trading Market for Data Based on CESS Cloud Data Network (FMD-CESS) realizes point-to-point trusted transactions of decentralized data, data rights confirmation, and privacy protection based on blockchain technology.

## üçÅ We have completed the following tasks during the Hackathon

### 1. FMD-CESS data marketplace has been developed, which features

- **One-stop data exchange service**. It supports the entire data exchange lifecycle from data uploading, data publishing to data finding, data purchase, and data downloading.

- **Supports multiple data formats**. It supports all data formats including texts, images, audio and video; data categories in various industries including education, medical, and IT. More industry fields will be covered in the future.

- **Public data searching function**. Users can browse and search all available public data on the platform, and filter data based on pre-defined criteria.

- **Data recommendation**. The platform recommends trending data to users.

- **Data value exploration**. The ultimate value of a data asset will be reached through free trading between data providers and users.

- **Decentralization**. The free trading platform allows providers and consumers to enter/exit the marketplace without restrictions. Data storage and exchange are powered by blockchain technology.

- **Data rights confirmation**. Our refined technology protects data ownership based on the well tested algorithms.

- **Data security**. Client data are stored with protection from the Proof of Data Reduplication and Recovery (PoDR¬≤) technology, protection including  reduplication and erasure coding. 99.9999% data integrity is guaranteed.

### 2. CESS Cloud Data Network

CESS constructed a stable and reliable underlying infrastructure. CESS Cloud Data Network has unlimited scalability, supporting the stability of FMD-CESS and allowing users securely visiting the storage resources. In addition, every node can become a massive decentralized cloud storage system individually.

CESS Cloud Data Network has been developed, which features

- **On-chain meta-data storage**. Supports uploading of file meta-data to the blockchain, including the file owner, file name, file size, file characteristics, keywords, download fee, expiration date&time, etc.

- **Registration with staking**. Provides a staking and registration function for storage miners. Only storage miners who successfully staking and registration are eligible to participate in storage mining.

- **Data storage proofs submission and verification**. Storage miners need to provide data storage proofs to blockchain during the lifecycle of a stored data file. Both Proof-of-Replication and Proof-of-SpaceTime will be supported.

- **Rewards and punishments for miners**. Rewards and punishments are based on storage proofs. Practical rewards and punishment rules need to be designed, in which rewards will be based on the ratio of the storage miners‚Äô current storage power to the overall network storage power. If storage proofs are not submitted on time, corresponding punishment measures will be taken.

- **Deployment of wss and Docker**. Provides a quick and convenient way to start.

### 3. Cumulus Encrypted Storage System

## üê• Team

The project is developed by the engineering team of 4 members:

- **Teh Sunn Liu**, front end developer, India
- **Yeou Sunn Liu**, blockchain developer, India
- **Jack Liu**, blockchain developer, India
- **Ted Zhang**,Go developer (decentralized storage), China

## üé¢ Challenges we ran into

We ran into many challenges, including but not limited to, the accuracy issue of data rights confirmation algorithm, implementing interoperability between programs coded in different languages (e.g., JS, Go, and Java) and blockchain RPC methods, embedding of complicated modules, and optimization of blockchain speed and stability. We tackled these issues in various ways such as, testing with a large number of data samples, studying and debugging with the SDK interface of each programming language, fixing error reporting via divide-and-conquer, optimizing storage categories, and reducing frequent use of the hooks attribute.

## üèÜ Accomplishments that I'm proud of

We completed the project based on our past design and development experience of Substrate, Ethereum, Filecoin, and other blockchain projects. We hope that, in the future, the fully constructed and well-tested CESS network will become a valuable parachain of the Polkadot ecosystem. All the components that we have created can be put to use for decentralized systems. Our work meets the expectations of the Hackathon for the following reasons:

**Contributions to decentralization and Web 3.0 (25%)**. From the supply side, the method of storage mining encourages excess or unused resources to join the decentralized network via a token incentive economy. The storage providers accept the data storage requests from clients. From the demand side, clients upload data files to a decentralized cloud data network, and the data files are distributed globally to different nodes. Clients pay for the data access service provided by miners.

**Innovation and creativity (25%)**. CESS incentivizes unused or under-utilized storage resources to join the blockchain network, to create a secure and scalable global decentralized data ecosystem, which is secured by multiple storage proof schemes and multi-format data rights confirmation mechanism. The multiple proof schemes are Proof of Data Reduplication and Recovery (PoDR¬≤), Proof of Replications (PoRep), Proof of Spacetime (PoSt). The multi-format data rights confirmation (MDRC) mechanism consists of algorithms that process data files and currently confirm ownerships for texts, images.

**Technical difficulties (25%)**. The project covers a wide range of substrate built-in components such as BABE, Staking, Scheduler, Polkadot-JS API, and GSRPC. These components change consistently and rapidly. It is very challenging to implement multiple storage proof schemes as pallets under the Substrate framework.  In addition, It is not easy to choose a similarity algorithm to achieve a high-accuracy data rights confirmation. Designing workflow for proof of storage to integrate into the blockchain system is also a major difficulty.

**User experience (25%)**. Early customers are storage miners and enterprises. We already demonstrated our testnet system to some clients and received very positive feedback.

## üé£ What I learned

Our team has learned a lot from the Hackathon project. First, we overcome the challenges in a fast-paced development environment with many dependencies. We quickly adapted to the new design and development model in the blockchain and decentralized world. We studied and gained skills in Rust, Cargo, etc. Also, we built a stronger team through teamwork and experience of communicating with organizations overseas.

## üìê What is next for the FMD-CESS?

The upcoming functions for the data trading platform include: data trading on API, the design of data standard and trading standard, and data tracking risk control, etc.

## üìØ Mass Usability

FMD-CESS provides comprehensive solutions for data trading in the Polkadot ecosystem built on Substrate.

It is a one-stop decentralized data trading platform that provides data services for both private and commercial use. 

It is capable of processing big data in healthcare, real estate, financial, industrial sectors, etc.
